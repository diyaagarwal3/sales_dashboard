This project presents an interactive Sales Dashboard developed using R Shiny and the shinydashboard package, aimed at enabling dynamic exploration of sales performance data. The dashboard integrates multiple filters including date range, product category, sales region, and sales representative to allow granular analysis of sales trends. It highlights key performance indicators such as total sales, total quantity sold, and average discount, supported by visual analytics through line plots and bar charts. Users can observe sales fluctuations over time and identify top-performing categories with ease. The data table feature allows users to view and export filtered data for external analysis. Built using core R libraries such as `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `DT`, the application offers a responsive and user-friendly interface, making it a practical tool for business analysts, sales managers, and decision-makers seeking insights from structured sales datasets. This project not only demonstrates technical proficiency in R and Shiny but also showcases the practical application of data visualization in business intelligence.
